## **Part 1: Wealth**

1. **Wealth ≠ Salary**

   Wealth generates income even while you sleep. A salary trades your time for money — which isn’t scalable.
2. **Use leverage to grow without exhausting yourself**

   There are 3 types of leverage: capital, people, and products (software, media). The best leverage is software and the internet — scalable without linear labor.
3. **Learn to make good decisions instead of just working hard**

   Clear thinking and smart decisions matter more than blind effort.
4. **Develop specific knowledge**

   Learn and do things you love and are uniquely good at — things that can’t be easily replaced.
5. **Build a personal brand**

   Reputation is an asset. In today’s digital world, people come to you because of who you are, not just what you do.
6. **Own, don’t rent**

   Create products or own equity instead of only working for a paycheck. Ownership creates freedom.
7. **Create value first — profits come later**

   Successful people focus on providing value; money is the byproduct.
8. **Learn to sell and learn to build**

   Knowing how to sell and build things means you’ll never be poor.
9. **Be patient — results come from compounding**

   Assets, skills, and relationships grow exponentially over time.
10. **Work as if you’re playing**

    If your work feels like play, you’re likely using your specific knowledge.

## **Part 2: Happiness**

11. **Happiness is a skill that can be learned**

    It’s not a result, but a state of mind you can cultivate through habits and mindset.
12. **Letting go of desires is the root of freedom**

    All suffering comes from wanting things you don’t have.
13. **Meditation helps you understand yourself**

    Naval practices simple meditation: “Sit still and do nothing for an hour a day.”
14. **You don’t have to do anything to be happy**

    When you stop, you realize you already have enough — and that is happiness.
15. **Think independently — don’t follow the crowd**

    Don’t let others program your mind with their expectations or definitions of success.
16. **Your mind is a looping pattern**

    Without awareness, you get stuck in negative thought loops without realizing it.
17. **Let go of control — live in the present**

    You can’t control the world, but you can choose how to react.
18. **No success is worth prolonged unhappiness**

    If you lose peace to gain money, you’re not truly wealthy.
19. **Focus on yourself, not comparisons**

    Comparison is the formula for suffering. Racing against yourself is the path to peace.
20. **Everything great requires time and persistence**

    Happiness, wealth, and wisdom come from living intentionally and consistently.
