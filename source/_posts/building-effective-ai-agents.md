## Main Summary

### 1. Distinguishing Between **Workflows** and **Agents**

* **Workflow**: A series of predefined steps—great for clear, repeatable tasks. For example, a static prompt chain with search and summarization.
* **Agent**: More autonomous—plans steps dynamically, uses tools proactively, and adapts to the environment. Ideal for open-ended, complex tasks requiring reasoning and iteration.

### 2. General Principle: **Keep It Simple, Scale Only When Needed**

Anthropic recommends:

* Always start with the simplest solution: a single LLM call with retrieval and context injection.
* Only upgrade to a more complex agentic system when necessary, as it tends to be slower and more expensive.
* Avoid complex frameworks early on—many are hard to debug and can introduce unexpected issues.

### 3. Common **Design Patterns**

#### • Prompt Chaining

Break tasks into smaller steps, each depending on the previous step’s output.

#### • Routing

Classify the input, then route it to the appropriate module—useful for improving cost-efficiency and specialization.

#### • Parallelization & Voting

Run multiple agents or tasks in parallel, then aggregate or select the best outcome—boosts reliability.

#### • Orchestrator – Workers

A central “orchestrator” agent delegates subtasks to specialized “workers,” then combines the results—great for unpredictable workflows.

#### • Evaluator – Optimizer

One agent generates an output, another critiques or scores it, then the first iterates and improves. Useful for tasks needing high-quality refinement.

### 4. When to Use Agents?

Agents are most useful when:

* The task is ambiguous, without a clear flow.
* Planning, reasoning, or tool-use is needed.
* You have safeguards in place (guardrails), and cost-performance tradeoffs are acceptable.

### 5. Core Components of Agent Systems

1. **LLM with extensions**: Includes retrieval, memory, and tool-use capabilities.
2. **Well-defined tools**: Each tool should be clearly documented and described for the LLM to use effectively.
3. **System prompts**: Define goals, rules, and the desired behavior clearly.

##  Conclusion

Anthropic emphasizes:

* Favor **simplicity first**—only move to agents when the task demands it.
* Use agents only when the job is complex or open-ended.
* Apply well-known design patterns like Prompt Chaining, Routing, Orchestration, and Optimizer loops to create robust, debuggable, and scalable agent systems.
* Ensure tools are well-documented, guardrails are in place, and agents are properly evaluated.
