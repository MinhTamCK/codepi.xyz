With over 6,800+ purchases. 

Here's 5 things they do differently to 99% of brands (+ how you can copy them):

1. Discounts are your enemy

   If you want to build a brand that will be around in 5/10/20+ years protect your brand's equity. \
   \
   Other than a discount for email sign-ups, this brand has only run 1 sale in the last 2 years.
2. Boring cart\
   \
   This brand has the highest ATC > PUR rate I've ever seen (nearly 90%) \
   \
   We've made this possible by making the cart boring AF. 
   \
   The only thing users can do once they are in the cart is:
    - View store benefits
    - View payment methods
    - Click checkout CTA
3. Under promise / over deliver
