With over 6,800+ purchases. 

Here's 5 things they do differently to 99% of brands (+ how you can copy them):

1. Discounts are your enemy

   If you want to build a brand that will be around in 5/10/20+ years protect your brand's equity. \
   \
   Other than a discount for email sign-ups, this brand has only run 1 sale in the last 2 years.
2. Boring cart\
   \
   This brand has the highest ATC > PUR rate I've ever seen (nearly 90%) \
   \
   We've made this possible by making the cart boring AF. 
   \
   The only thing users can do once they are in the cart is:

   * View store benefits
   * View payment methods
   * Click checkout CTA
3. Under promise / over deliver\
   \
   With every order, customers receive a branded key ring, stickers, an advertorial leaflet and a wristband.\
   \
   All together these = less than $3 in value\
   \
   But the perceived value is insane! And it shows the brand cares!


4. Niche down\
   \
   In the 3 years I've known the founders not once have they considered expanding to reach new audiences.\
   \
   They've been laser-focused on becoming the leaders of their niche.\
   \
   Which is exactly what they've done! Being the 'go-to brand for x' can't be underestimated!
5. Sacrifice\
   \
   The biggest differentiator between them and 90%+ founders I know is their work ethic.\
   \
   They've sacrificed family time, weekends, holidays, etc. for 3 years straight.\
   \
   4am wake-ups, 7 days a week, 365 days\
   \
   Of course, this isn't for everyone but it works for them!
6. Bonus: delegate and hire!

   An underrated strength of successful founders is their ability to delegate and hire smarter people than them. \
   Of course, this has to be financially viable but hiring in growth areas of your biz can be HUGE.
