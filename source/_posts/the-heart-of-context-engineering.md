🧠 **AI Agent’s Memory: The Heart of Context Engineering**

If you're building AI Agents, **Memory** is one of the most critical components. It enables agents to plan, act, and respond effectively — not just in the moment, but with awareness of past interactions and relevant knowledge.

Let’s break down the core types of memory in Agentic Systems:

---

### 🔁 1. **Episodic Memory**

This is where the agent stores **past interactions** — both user messages and its own responses/actions. These are usually embedded and stored in a **Vector Database** to support semantic search and recall.

🧩 Example: Saving chat history or executed steps in a task automation flow.

---

### 📚 2. **Semantic Memory**

This represents the agent’s **knowledge base** — internal docs, Notion pages, PDFs, or contextual grounding needed to isolate relevant information from large corpora.

💡 Think of it like the memory behind RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

---

### ⚙️ 3. **Procedural Memory**

This holds the **system-level information**: the structure of the system prompt, tool registry, and constraints/guardrails. It’s usually versioned and managed in Git or registries.

🔧 This is where your agent knows “how to think and act.”

---

### 💡 4. **Pulling Memory into Context**

When the agent needs to solve a task, relevant memory from Episodic, Semantic, or Procedural memory is **retrieved** and added to the context window.

---

### 🧠 5. **Short-term (Working) Memory**

All retrieved information is compiled into the **final prompt** passed to the LLM:

* Prompt structure
* Available tools
* Reasoning & action history
* Additional context

This is where **real-time decision-making** happens.
