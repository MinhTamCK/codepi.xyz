Employees laid off by Amazon ~ 18000

Employees laid off by Google ~ 12000

Employees laid off by Microsoft ~ 10000

Employees laid off by Meta ~ 13000

Salesfore, Spotify, Cisco, and countless others have done the same.

This should be a wake-up call for anyone who thinks they can build a long-term career at any one company.

The truth is, businesses change, and when they do, employees can be let go.

My advice? Don't get too comfortable in any one job.

Instead, you should always be looking for ways to develop your skills and explore new opportunities.

Invest in yourself.

You are your own brand. Work on it, it will stay with you throughout your life!

💥 Unpopular oppinion:

When I got into contracting, everyone said it was very risky.

They said that being an employee is far more stable.

Then the layoffs in tech started happening. Companies that seemed extremely stable fired people instantly.

Tens of thousands of brilliant people are now jobless.

Really sad situation right there!

It’s only we who cling to this stability until the very moment it is no longer there.

And nothing is worse than perceiving something as stable, while in reality is not.

Your health, your happiness, your job, world peace, nothing. You may feel you have some control over this, but you don’t have total control, and even a small event can cause significant damage.

That’s why you never have to focus on how stable is job is, but rather on your own ability to land a similar or even better job in the event that the job is not stable anymore.

This mindset has to come from within you, from the trust that you are well-prepared, highly skilled, and able to bring a lot of value to any company you work for.

Improve yourself every day and in time you’ll stop being concerned with how stable your job is.
